In this Lab exercise, we were tasked with making a simple sprite game involving and player-controlled sprite and randomly spawning item sprites.

In the first exercise, we created the player sprite and made it move around using the arrow keys. We also created the item sprite, and made the player sprite animate when it came into contact with the item sprite. The link to the sketch is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/yK3iUX5Dd

In the second exercise, we extended the game to make the item also disappear when the player sprite came into contact with it. The sketch is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/Kcu8f4DF4

In the third exercise, we made 5 randomly spawning item sprites appear instead of only one. The sketch is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/W3HOxcRVA
